            <dt style="font-size: 24px">Hypoglycemia</dt>
            <dd>
Hypoglycemia is when the level of blood sugar is lower than normal. A normal blood sugar level is about 70 to 100 milligrams per deciliter. All of the cells in the body need sugar to do their jobs and to survive. When a person does not have enough blood sugar, their body cannot work normally.
Hypoglycemia can cause many symptoms. Some common symptoms are nausea, feeling hungry, sweating, feeling sad, and heart palpitations (feeling the heart pounding). Bad hypoglycemia can make a person act like they are drunk or have taken drugs. Very bad hypoglycemia can look like a stroke.
Hypoglycemia can happen to anyone, at any age, but it usually happens in people who are diabetic. It is often a complication of treatment for diabetes with insulin or oral medications.
Hypoglycemia is treated by returning the blood sugar levels back to normal. Often, a hypoglycemic person can bring their blood sugar levels back up by eating. In the worst cases, when the blood sugar is very low, hypoglycemia is treated by giving sugar water intravenously (through a needle placed into a vein). In some cases, the liver is able to handle the issue by making glucose.
The brain and other parts of the body cannot work without sugar. Because of this, severe (very bad) hypoglycemia can cause serious medical problems (like seizures) or even death if it is not treated quickly enough.

            <dt style="font-size: 24px">Tuberculosis</dt>
            <dd>
Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by bacteria.

Tuberculosis can have many symptoms. The most common include:

A cough that does not go away, especially if the person is coughing up blood (this is called hemoptysis)
Chest pain
Not having any appetite
Weakness
Weight loss
Chills
Very pale skin
Listless eyes
Fever
Sweating a lot at night
Difficulty breathing
Feeling very tired
People are also more likely to get tuberculosis if they live close to other people who have TB. For example, TB can spread easily in homeless shelters, prisons, and immigrant
</dd>
            <dt style="font-size: 24px">AIDS</dt><dd>
Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a disease caused by a virus called HIV.
Acquired means that people are not born with the disease. They get it after being infected with the HIV virus.
Immune or Immuno- talks about the immune system. The immune system is the part of the body that fights off disease.
Deficiency means not to be enough. An immuno-deficiency is a problem where the immune system is damaged and cannot fight off diseases to keep the body healthy.
Syndrome is a collection of symptoms, or problems in the body. Because the immune system is damaged, and cannot fight off disease, people with AIDS get a collection of symptoms which is referred to as the "Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome."

HIV can be spread by some body fluids that have HIV in them:

Blood
Semen
Fluids from a woman's vagina
Fluids from the rectum
Breast milk
From infected mother to child during pregnancy (Transplacental).

This means a person can get HIV by:[4]

Having sex with a person with HIV without using condoms or other types of protection
This includes anal sex and (sometimes) oral sex
Sharing needles with someone who has HIV (to inject illegal drugs like heroin)
Getting stuck with a needle that has been used on someone with HIV (this happens sometimes to healthcare workers like doctors and nurses)
A mother with HIV can pass HIV on to her baby while she is pregnant or if she breast-feeds the baby

How is HIV not spread?

HIV is NOT spread by:[4]

Body fluids like saliva (spit), tears, or sweat
Touching a person with HIV (like shaking hands or hugging)
Sharing dishes or drinking from the same glass as someone with HIV
Light switches or toilet seats
Drinking fountains
Air or water
Insects, like mosquitoes

            <dt style="font-size: 24px">Osteoarthritis</dt><dd>
Osteoarthritis normally affects older people: it is a disease where joints wear out. As the joint surface wears away, it sheds particles which stimulate the joint lining to produce fluid. This causes the joint to swell. When the joint cartilage wears away, the core of the bone becomes exposed. The exposed bone rubs against other exposed bone.

Symptoms
Joints will be stiff and painful, and may be swollen. The pain may be worse after exercise. It may get harder to move the joint.
</dd>
            <dt style="font-size: 24px">Heart attack</dt><dd>An acute myocardial infarction, also called a heart attack, happens when a blood vessel in the heart suddenly becomes blocked. Blood vessels carry blood and oxygen. When a blood vessel in the heart gets blocked, blood cannot get to part of the heart. This part of the heart does not get enough oxygen. This is called ischemia. When the heart muscle becomes ischemic (does not get enough blood and oxygen), the ischemia often causes chest pain. This is called Angina Pectoris. If the ischemia lasts long enough, the heart muscle that is not getting enough oxygen dies. This is called an infarction. "Myocardial infarction" means "infarction (muscle death) in the heart muscle."

A heart attack is a medical emergency. The first few minutes are very important for keeping the person alive. Some of the damage from the heart attack can be repaired if the person gets treatment during the first hour of the attack.
Symptoms:

Signs that a person is having a heart attack show over several minutes, and rarely come immediately. Most people having a heart attack have chest pain. Sometimes, people also have pain in the left arm, the lower jaw, the neck, the right arm, the back, or in parts of the abdomen.

Many women have different symptoms than men. The most common symptoms include shortness of breath (trouble breathing), weakness, and feeling very tired. Some women feel tired, do not sleep properly, and have shortness of breath for up to a month before they have a heart attack. Women may also have nausea and stomach upset when having a heart attack.

Sometimes, people have "silent heart attacks." These are heart attacks that do not cause any pain. They are more common in elderly people, women, and people with diabetes. In these people, suddenly feeling very tired, or fainting, may be the only sign of a heart attack.


Treatment:


The animation shows how plaque buildup or a coronary artery spasm can lead to a heart attack and how blocked blood flow in a coronary artery can lead to a heart attack.
A heart attack is a medical emergency that needs treatment as quickly as possible. The most important thing is to save as much myocardium (heart muscle) as possible and prevent more complications. As time passes, the risk of damage to the heart muscle increases.

Doctors or paramedics usually start certain treatments as soon as a heart attack is suspected. These treatments include:[1]

Aspirin. Aspirin is an early and important treatment for a heart attack. Aspirin keeps platelets from sticking together, and can help prevent more blood clots from forming inside the blood vessels and the heart.
Nitroglycerin (nitro). Nitro widens the blood vessels in the heart. This makes it easier for blood to flow through those vessels to the heart.
Oxygen (if needed). If the patient is having trouble breathing, oxygen can be given.
Pain medicine for chest pain (if needed).
Once doctors are sure that a person is having a heart attack, there are two main treatments: "clot-busting medicines" (thrombolytics) and percutaneous coronary intervention.[1]

            <dt style="font-size: 24px">Gastroenteritis</dt><dd>Gastroenteritis is a medical term for inflammation of the stomach and intestines. It causes diarrhea, vomiting and stomach pain. It usually happens because of infection by a virus or bacteria.[1]

Other common terms for gastroenteritis include infectious diarrhea, stomach bug, and stomach virus. It is sometimes called stomach flu or gastric flu, but it is not related to the influenza virus (which is often shortened to 'flu').

Arthritis

Arthritis is a group of diseases where a person or animal's body joints are damaged. "Arthritis" means inflammation of bone or body joint. Arthritis can cause pain, swelling, and stiffness. It can hurt to move with arthritis. Arthritis is a condition that lasts for a long time.[1]

Forms of diseases

There are more than 100 kinds of arthritis. The three most common kinds are osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and gout. Other kinds of arthritis include psoriatic arthritis and septic arthritis (when an area is invaded by bacteria).

Osteoarthritis is when the cartilage in between two bones breaks down. This condition causes the bones to rub together. This kind of arthritis is more common in elderly people. The most common places for this arthritis are the hips, knees, lower back, and neck. There are medicines that can relieve the pain and prevent disability.[2]

Rheumatoid arthritis is caused by autoimmunity. Autoimmunity is when the body's immune system attacks its own tissues. The most common places for this arthritis is in the wrists and the knuckles. It usually starts between the ages of 20 and 40. Children and elderly people can also get this kind of arthritis. There are medicines to slow down the process of this disease. There are also some medicines to relieve pain. It is important to treat this kind of arthritis early.[2]

Gout causes severe pain and swelling. Gout normally affects the big toe. It can also affect heels, ankles, hands, wrists or elbows. Gout is from high levels of uric acid that is in the blood. Gout can cause urate crystals to settle in tissues of joints. Gout creates stone-like shapes. The stone-like shapes build in joints, ligaments and tendons.[2]

Arthritis is more common in older people. Both osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis affect women more often than men.

Animals, including dogs and cats, can also get arthritis.</dd>
            <dt style="font-size: 24px">Vertigo</dt><dd>Vertigo: a person feels as if the world around them is spinning, or that they are spinning, or the spinning is in their head. Vertigo can be caused by different medical conditions; when it happens because of a migraine it is called migraine-associated vertigo. It may happen before a migraine headache starts or during the headache, but vertigo is most common during the period of time between headaches. Many people who have migraines have vertigo or dizziness as the main symptom instead of a headache.[1]

There are different way of vertigo associated with migraines, making a person feel; from feeling lightheaded or:

Episodic true vertigo:

Positional vertigo: which happens when a person holds their head in a certain positions.
Constant imbalance:
Movement associated dysequilibrium: different types of movement may cause vertigo.

            <dt style="font-size: 24px">Urinary tract infection</dt><dd>A urinary tract infection (UTI) is an infection caused by bacteria in part of the urinary tract. In the lower urinary tract, it is simple cystitis (a bladder infection). In the upper urinary tract, it is a kidney infection. Symptoms from a lower urinary tract infection include painful peeing and frequent peeing or wanting to pee (or both). Symptoms of a kidney infection include fever and side and back pain. In old people and young children, the symptoms are not always so clear. The main cause for both types is the bacteria Escherichia coli. Other bacteria, viruses, or fungus may be the cause in rare cases.

Women get urinary tract infections more often than men. Half of women have an infection at some point in their lives. It is common to have repeated infections. Risk factors include sexual intercourse as well as family history. Sometimes a person who had a bladder infection will get a kidney infection. Kidney infection may also, but rarely, be caused by bacteria in the blood. Diagnosis in young healthy women can be based on symptoms alone. Sometimes, the urine needs to be tested. A person with frequent infections can take low-dose antibiotics to prevent future infections.

Antibiotics are used to treat simple cases of urinary tract infections. Resistance to antibiotics is increasing. People who have complicated urinary tract infections sometimes have to take antibiotics for a longer time, or might take antibiotics intravenously (through a vein). If symptoms have not improved in two or three days, the person will need further tests. In women, urinary tract infections are the most common form of bacterial infection. Ten percent of women develop urinary tract infections each year.

            <dt style="font-size: 24px">Hepatitis E</dt><dd>
Hepatitis E is inflammation of the liver caused by infection with the hepatitis E virus (HEV);[1][2] it is a type of viral hepatitis.[3]

Hepatitis E has mainly a fecal-oral transmission that is similar to hepatitis A, but the viruses are unrelated.[4][5][6]

The earliest known epidemic of hepatitis E happened in 1955 in New Delhi,[7] but the virus was not discovered until 1983, by Russian scientists investigating an outbreak in Afghanistan.[8]

One of five known human hepatitis viruses: hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E.</dd>
            <dt style="font-size: 24px">Dengue</dt><dd>Dengue fever (pronounced "DEN-gi") is a tropical infectious disease caused by the dengue virus. People get the dengue virus from mosquitoes. Dengue fever is also called break-bone fever, because it can cause so much pain that people feel like their bones are breaking.

Most people with dengue fever can get better just by drinking enough water. However, a small number of people get dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome. These are medical emergencies and can kill a person if they do not get medical treatment.

There is no vaccine that can keep people from getting the dengue virus. There is also no treatment to cure dengue fever. Doctors can only provide "supportive care," which means they can only treat dengue's symptoms.

Since the 1960s, many more people have been getting dengue fever. Since World War II, dengue has become a problem around the world. It is common in more than 110 countries. Every year, between 50 million and 100 million people get dengue fever.

Signs and symptoms

Most people who get the dengue virus (80%) have no symptoms, or have only mild symptoms (like a basic fever).[1][2][3] About 5% of infected people (or 5 out of every 100) get much sicker. A small number of these people have symptoms that could kill them.[1][3]

After a person gets the dengue virus from a mosquito, it takes between 3 and 14 days for them to get sick. (This is called the virus's incubation period.) Most often, people start to feel sick after 4 to 7 days.[4]

Often, when children have dengue fever, their symptoms are the same as gastroenteritis (stomach flu), like vomiting and diarrhea, or the common cold.[5] However, children are more likely to have bad complications from dengue fever.[6]

Dengue fever happens in three stages: febrile, critical, and recovery.</dd>
            <dt style="font-size: 24px">Drug Reaction</dt><dd>A drug allergy is the abnormal reaction of your immune system to a medication. Any medication — over-the-counter, prescription or herbal — is capable of inducing a drug allergy. However, a drug allergy is more likely with certain medications.

The most common signs and symptoms of drug allergy are hives, rash or fever. A drug allergy may cause serious reactions, including a life-threatening condition that affects multiple body systems (anaphylaxis).

A drug allergy is not the same as a drug side effect, a known possible reaction listed on a drug label. A drug allergy is also different from drug toxicity caused by an overdose of medication.

Symptoms
Signs and symptoms of a serious drug allergy often occur within an hour after taking a drug. Other reactions, particularly rashes, can occur hours, days or weeks later.

Drug allergy signs and symptoms may include:

Skin rash
Hives
Itching
Fever
Swelling
Shortness of breath
Wheezing
Runny nose
Itchy, watery eyes</dd>
            <dt style="font-size: 24px">Hyperthyroidism</dt><dd>Hyperthyroidism is a medical condition. It is caused by a thyroid gland that is too active. The thyroid gland makes hormones. These hormones manage the body’s metabolism. An example of one of these hormones is thyroxine. The thyroid-stimulating hormone starts the making of thyroxine. The thyroid-stimulating hormone is also called “TSH.” TSH is made in the pituitary gland. Hyperthyroidism is determined by a doctor by blood tests that show a decreased thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level.[1]

The most common cause of this disorder is "Graves’ disease.” Graves’ disease is a condition in which the thyroid gland becomes overactive. Antibodies from the immune system in the bloodstream attack itself (this is called an autoimmune disease). This causes the thyroid gland to grow, as well as produce more thyroid hormones.[2]

Some symptoms of this disorder are the swelling of the neck, as well as weight loss. In addition, patients could experience their hands trembling, as well as their blood pressure increasing. They could also experience nervousness and anxiety attacks.[3] Medication can stop the effects of hyperthyroidism. However, hyperthyroidism cannot be fixed completely. Hyperthyroidism can occasionally cause death.[4]

            <dt style="font-size: 24px">Chronic cholestatic</dt><dd>Chronic cholestatic diseases, whether occurring in infancy, childhood or adulthood, are characterized by defective bile acid transport from the liver to the intestine, which is caused by primary damage to the biliary epithelium in most cases. In this article, approaches to diagnosis and management of the main specific disorders are provided and some of the recent developments in this field are discussed. Major advances in the understanding of the cellular and molecular physiology of bile secretion have led to identification of genetic defects responsible for the different types of progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC). The potential role of the genes involved in PFIC in some adult cholestatic disorders remains to be determined. The majority of adult patients with chronic cholestasis have primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) or primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). Recently, variant forms of PBC have been described. The term autoimmune cholangitis is used to describe patients having chronic non-suppurative cholangitis with negative antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA) but positive antinuclear and/or antismooth muscle antibodies. Autoimmune cholangitis and AMA-positive PBC are quite similar in terms of clinical presentation, survival and response to ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) therapy. In contrast, autoimmune cholangitis must be distinguished from PBC-autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) overlap syndrome in which biochemical and histological characteristics of both PBC and AIH coexist. Combination of UDCA and corticosteroids is required in most patients with overlap syndrome to obtain a complete clinical and biochemical response. Long-term UDCA treatment improves survival without liver transplantation in PBC patients. Among the putative mechanisms of the beneficial effects of UDCA, description of anti-apoptotic properties and effect on endotoxin disposal in biliary cells have provided new insights. In patients with incomplete response to UDCA, combination of UDCA with antiinflammatory or immunosuppressive drugs is under evaluation. Variant forms of PSC have also been described, including PSC-AIH overlap syndrome, especially in children or young adults, and small-duct PSC, which is characterized by normal cholangiogram in patients having chronic cholestasis, histologic features compatible with PSC and inflammatory bowel disease. Development of cholangiocarcinoma (CC) is a major feature of PSC, occurring in 10-15% of patients. Early diagnosis of CC is a difficult challenge, although positron emission tomography seems a promising tool. Unlike PBC, effective medical therapy is not yet available in PSC, reflecting the lack of knowledge about the exact pathogenesis of the disease. Currently, liver transplantation is the only effective therapy for patients with advanced disease, although recurrence of PSC in the graft may occur.

            <dt style="font-size: 24px">Typhoid</dt><dd>Typhoid, or typhoid fever, is an illness caused by the bacterium Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica.[1] Symptoms may vary from mild to severe, and usually begin 6 to 30 days after exposure. The disease is spread by water which has the bacteria in it.

The disease:

Typhoid usually lasts between two weeks and a month. The symptoms of typhoid often appear 10 to 14 days after infection. If no treatment is given, between one and three out of every ten patients die. The rest usually get better after a month, at the most.

Typhoid causes a steady fever of at least 103–104 degrees F (39–40 degrees C). Also, it can cause stomach pains, headache, being delirious (restless, excited, seeing things), and not being hungry. In some cases, flat, pink coloured spots show up on the patient's body. Sometimes there are no symptoms.

Typhoid is not common in countries with good sanitation and clean water. For example, scientists think that there are only 400 cases a year in the United States. In 2015, 12.5 million new cases worldwide were reported.[3] For example, in the Indian subcontinent, typhoid is one of the most common diseases because of poor sanitation and lack of basic hygiene.In that case, typhoid fever is common in children of the one to 15 years age group.

The disease can be treated with antibiotics. There are standard drugs like chloromycetin which cure typhoid.</dd>
            <dt style="font-size: 24px">Hepatitis B</dt><dd>Hepatitis B is a disease of the liver. It is caused by a virus. The virus is not spread by food or casual contact. It can be spread by blood or body fluids from an infected person. A baby can get it from its mother during childbirth. It can also be spread by sexual contact,[1] reuse of needles,[2] and transfusions of blood with the virus in it.[3]

Infection with hepatitis B can be prevented by vaccination, where an injection is given which makes the body immune to the virus. It is recommended that all people are given a series of three vaccines over a few months when they are babies to ensure good protection against this virus. However, vaccination only provides 90% protection, it does not completely remove the risk of infection.[4]

Some people who are infected are able to beat the virus quickly. Many people are infected for life. Usually they have few or no symptoms. Sometimes the liver is damaged severely, causing liver failure. A common symptom of liver failure is jaundice, where the person's skin and eyes turn yellow due to a build-up of body products which would normally be filtered by the liver. Another problem with hepatitis B is that it can cause cancer of the liver.[5]

Blood tests can find signs that the liver is being damaged. If people have those signs, treatment for hepatitis B can prevent the liver damage caused by the virus. Antiviral medications are given, which prevent the virus from making copies of itself. However, once the virus is in the liver, it is not possible to get rid of the virus completely.
</dd>
            <dt style="font-size: 24px">Hepatitis A</dt><dd>Hepatitis A is an infection of the liver caused by the hepatitis A virus. Unlike the other common forms of hepatitis (hepatitis B and C), it does not cause chronic (long-term) liver disease.

How is hepatitis A spread?
When a person has hepatitis A, the virus stays in their feces. Hepatitis A is usually spread by eating food or drinking water that has been contaminated with infected feces.[1] For example, hepatitis A can be spread by:[1]

Using ice that was made from contaminated water
Eating fruits, vegetables, or other foods that are not cooked, which may have gotten contaminated when a person with hepatitis A prepared them
Foods that are not cooked are more likely to spread hepatitis A because cooking food will kill the virus
Eating shellfish that lived in contaminated water, and were not cooked well enough to kill the virus
Hepatitis A can also be spread by having sex with someone who has hepatitis A.[1]

Signs and symptoms:

Jaundice (yellow skin and eyes)
Abdominal pain
Fever
Nausea and Vomiting
Fatigue
Anorexia (loss of the desire to eat)[2]

Treatment and prognosis:

There is no medication that can cure hepatitis A. In most cases, the infection resolves on its own. In most cases, symptoms last less than 2 months, although some people are sick for as long as six months.[1]

Unfortunately, a small number of patients develop Fulminant hepatic failure, which is very serious.

Prevention
A vaccine is available to prevent hepatitis A, and anti-hepatitis A immunoglobulin is also used.</dd>
            <dt style="font-size: 24px">Jaundice</dt><dd>Jaundice (also called icterus) is when the skin and the whites of the eyes become a yellow color.[1] People with jaundice have a problem with their liver, which stops it from removing heme properly. Heme (from hemoglobin) changes to a chemical called bilirubin after red blood cell death.[1] Bilirubin causes the yellow coloring of the skin. Jaundice is common in newly born babies. It usually starts the second day after birth.[2]

Jaundice can also be caused by other diseases, like malaria, hepatitis, or gallstones.

Jaundice is the most common of all liver problems. The yellow colour of the skin and mucous membranes happens because of an increase in the bile pigment, bilirubin, in the blood.[2]

The bile, made by the liver, is a vital digestive fluid needed for proper nutrition. It also stops decaying changes in food. If the bile is stopped from entering the intestines there is an increase in gases and other products. Normally, the production of bile and its flow is constant.

Symptoms:
The symptoms of jaundice are:[3]

extreme weakness
headache
fever
loss of appetite
tiredness
severe constipation
nausea
yellow coloration of the eyes, tongue, skin and urine.
dull pain in the liver region.
Obstructive jaundice may also cause intense itching.

            <dt style="font-size: 24px">Diabetes  mellitus</dt><dd>Diabetes is a condition that results from lack of the hormone insulin in a person's blood, or when the body has a problem using the insulin it produces (insulin resistance). There is another disease with a similar name, diabetes insipidus, however, they are not related. When people say "diabetes", they usually mean diabetes mellitus. People with diabetes Mellitus are called "diabetics".

Glucose is not regular sugar that is available in stores and supermarkets. Glucose is a natural carbohydrate that our bodies use as a source of energy. The kind of sugar sold in supermarkets is called sucrose, and is much different from glucose. High concentrations of glucose can be found in soft drinks and fruits.[1]

The glucose level in the blood is controlled by several hormones. Hormones are chemicals in the body that send messages from cells to other cells. Insulin is a hormone made by the pancreas. When you eat, the pancreas makes insulin to send a message to other cells in the body. This insulin tells the cells to take up glucose from the blood. The glucose is used by cells for energy. Extra glucose that is not needed right away is stored in some cells as glycogen. When you are not eating, cells break down the stored glycogen into glucose to use as energy.

            <dt style="font-size: 24px">Common Cold</dt><dd>The common cold[1] is caused by viruses. It spreads easily, so it is very infectious. The symptoms are mostly in the upper respiratory system. Its damage is mostly felt in the nose and throat. The symptoms include coughs, painful throat, runny nose and fever. These symptoms usually last seven to ten days, but sometimes up to three weeks. Over two hundred different viruses can cause the common cold:[2] that is why the details vary so much. Rhinoviruses are the most common cause.

The common cold mostly hurts the nose, pharynx, throat, and the sinuses (sinusitis). The symptoms come from the immune system's response to the infection, not from direct destruction by the viruses themselves. Hand washing is good, but the viruses also spread through moist air. Close contact with infected people is common in many cities. Wearing face masks might help, especially on any mass transit system (railways, underground, buses...).

There is no cure for the common cold, but the symptoms can be treated. It is the most frequent infectious disease in humans. The average person gets two to three colds every year. The average child gets between 6 and 12 colds every year. These colds have been with humans for as long as we have a history.



Signs and symptoms
The most common symptoms of a cold are a cough, runny nose, a stuffy nose, and a sore throat. Other issues are sore muscles, feeling tired, headache, and not wanting to eat.[3] Around 40% of people with colds have a sore throat, while around 50% have a cough.[4] Muscle ache happens in about half of the cases.[5] A fever is an uncommon symptom in adults, but it is common in infants and young children.[5] The cough caused by a cold is usually mild compared to a cough caused by influenza (the flu).[5] A cough and a fever indicate a higher likelihood of the flu in adults.[6] A number of the viruses that cause the common cold may also result in no symptoms.[7][8] The color of the mucus that is coughed up from the lungs (sputum) may vary in color from clear to yellow to green. This color does not indicate if an infection is caused by viruses or bacteria.[9]

            <dt style="font-size: 24px">Acne</dt><dd>Acne is an infection of the skin, caused by changes in the sebaceous glands. The most common form of acne is called acne vulgaris, which means "common acne". The redness comes from the inflammation of the skin in response to the infection.

Oils from the glands combine with dead skin cells to block hair follicles. Under the blocked pore, oil builds up. Skin bacteria can then grow very quickly. This infection makes the skin become swollen and red, which becomes visible.

The face, chest, back, and upper arms are most common places for acne to happen.

Acne is common during puberty, when a person is turning from a child into an adult, because of high levels of hormones. Acne becomes less common as people reach adulthood.

There are lots of acne treatment methods available, including natural treatments.


Physical effects
Acne causes scarring, and acne pustules can be very painful and sensitive.

Psychological effects
People suffering from a bad case of acne, especially adolescents, can develop low self-esteem which can lead to depression.

Social effects
Low self-esteem issues can make a person suffering from acne withdraw from many social events. It makes developing new personal relationships (especially love relationships) more difficult. Low self-esteem can also cause problems with career advancement as the person may find it difficult to present a positive attitude. This may sometimes even lead to suicidal thoughts.[1] Some of the treatments for acne have also shown a link with more suicide attempts.[2]

Causes of acne
Exactly why some people get acne and some do not is not completely known. These can cause acne, or make it worse:

Hormonal fluctuation
Hyperactive sebaceous glands
Stress
Many dead skin cells staying on the skin
Bacteria in the pores
Diet[3]
Aspirin reduces inflammation which in result, reduces facial redness due to acne.

Treatments
Many things are sold to treat acne, the most popular being benzoyl peroxide. Many of these things have not been scientifically proven to help acne. However, a mix of commercial and homemade treatments can help with acne for various reasons.[source?]

Killing the bacteria that grow in the blocked follicles. This can be done by ingesting antibiotic medication, or by putting antibiotics on the skin. Antibiotics act quickly and are a powerful way of temporarily getting rid of acne. When the body develops a resistance to the antibiotics, the bacteria returns stronger than before.
Removing oil on the skin can be done by taking drugs that contain Vitamin A. Accutane is the name of the most famous treatment using massive quantities of Vitamin A.
Removing dead skin cells can be done by treatment with salicylic acid. This encourages the skin to peel away the top layer of cells.
Diet: studies have shown that acne is quite rare in areas with different diets, and particular food items have been shown to exacerbate acne.[3]
Popping a pimple should not be done by anyone but a qualified dermatologist. Pimple popping irritates skin, can make the bacteria spread, and can cause scars. If you must pop a pimple yourself, it is advised to apply warm water to the area before popping it and to wash your hand thoroughly before beginning so as to avoid spreading bacteria via the hands. Applying hot water will open up the pores and reduce the damage because it will require less force to pop it.

It can be caused by many factors, but it is more common when a person has insufficient iodine. Severe hypothyroidism in infants can result in cretinism. Symptoms of hypothyroidism include the following: tiredness, headaches, weight gain, dry skin, constipation, and poor concentration.
            Symptoms

Fatigue
Feeling cold
Poor memory and concentration
Constipation
Weight gain with poor appetite
Shortness of breath
Hoarse voice

            <dt style="font-size: 24px">Bronchiale Asthma</dt><dd>
Asthma (or Asthma bronchiale) is a disease that hurts the airways inside the lungs. It causes the tissue inside the airways to swell. Asthma also causes the bands of muscle around the airways to become narrow. This makes it hard for enough air to pass through and for the person to breathe normally. Asthma also causes mucus-making cells inside the airways to make more mucus than normal. This blocks the airways, which are already very narrow during an asthma attack, and makes it even more difficult to breathe.

A person having an asthma attack often makes wheezing sounds when trying to breathe. This is the sound of air trying to pass through the very narrow airway. They also have shortness of breath, which means they cannot take a full deep breath. Chest tightness may happen which feels like their chest is being squeezed. They may also cough a lot.

Asthma attacks can be a medical emergency because they can be fatal (cause a person to die). There is no cure for asthma. There are treatments such as different kinds of medicines to help people with asthma. There are also things that people with asthma can do to help themselves to keep their asthma from getting worse.

There are a lot of risk factors for getting asthma. The exact reasons for each is not yet clearly understood. Some of the factors are believed to come from genetics. A person inherits genetic mutations from one or both of their parents that may increase the chances of developing asthma. Epigenetics, which are changes in the way a gene acts, may also increase their chances of getting asthma. These epigenetic changes may also be inherited. They may happen when a baby is still growing inside its mother, or during childhood.

Socioeconomic status (SES) is also believed to play a part in developing asthma. A person's socioeconomic status is based on such things as how much money their family makes, where they live, and their education level. Race and ethnicity also may play a part. It also is related to access to medical care, personal beliefs, and dietary habits. People of lower socioeconomic status suffer higher rates of asthma, have worse outcomes, and also have higher asthma-related death rates than people of higher economic status.

            <dt style="font-size: 24px">Hypertension</dt><dd>Hypertension or high blood pressure is a chronic medical condition in which the blood pressure in the arteries is higher than it should be. This involves the heart working harder than normal to circulate blood through the blood vessels.

Blood pressure

The pressure in the arteries changes depending on what the heart is doing. When the heart squeezes, pumping blood into the arteries, the pressure increases. When the heart relaxes, the pressure decreases. When blood pressure is measured, the highest pressure (when the heart is squeezing) is called the systolic blood pressure. The lowest pressure (when the heart is relaxing) is called the diastolic blood pressure.

Blood pressure is written as two numbers. For example, in the picture at the right, the person's systolic blood pressure was 158. Their diastolic blood pressure was 99. This blood pressure is written as 158/99. It is said "158 over 99."

Complications

Hypertension can cause many problems, including heart attack, stroke, Aneurysm, congestive heart failure, kidney failure, vision loss, Metabolic syndrome, Dementia, etc..[1]

To stay healthy, most people should try to keep their blood pressure below 140/90 mmHg.[2]
Risk Factors
The risk factors includes age, Race, Family history or genes, obesity, lack of physical activity, chewing or smoking tobacco, too much salt in diet, not enough potassium in diet, alcohol, stress, kidney disease, diabetes and sleep apnea.[1]


Treatment

Lifestyle changes
Hypertension can often be fixed with changes in diet or lifestyle. The 2004 British Hypertension Society suggests that people with high blood pressure:[3]

Lose weight if they are overweight or obese
Exercise regularly
Decrease the amount of salt they eat
Limit the amount of alcohol they drink
Eat a lot of fruits and vegetables

            <dt style="font-size: 24px"></dt><dd>Peptic ulcers are open sores that develop on the inside lining of your stomach and the upper portion of your small intestine. The most common symptom of a peptic ulcer is stomach pain.

Peptic ulcers include:

Gastric ulcers that occur on the inside of the stomach
Duodenal ulcers that occur on the inside of the upper portion of your small intestine (duodenum)


Symptoms:

Burning stomach pain
Feeling of fullness, bloating or belching
Intolerance to fatty foods
Heartburn
Nausea
The most common peptic ulcer symptom is burning stomach pain. Stomach acid makes the pain worse, as does having an empty stomach. The pain can often be relieved by eating certain foods that buffer stomach acid or by taking an acid-reducing medication, but then it may come back. The pain may be worse between meals and at night.

Many people with peptic ulcers don't even have symptoms.

Less often, ulcers may cause severe signs or symptoms such as:

Vomiting or vomiting blood — which may appear red or black
Dark blood in stools, or stools that are black or tarry
Trouble breathing
Feeling faint
Nausea or vomiting
Unexplained weight loss
Appetite changes

            <dt style="font-size: 24px"></dt><dd>
Cervical spondylosis is a general term for age-related wear and tear affecting the spinal disks in your neck. As the disks dehydrate and shrink, signs of osteoarthritis develop, including bony projections along the edges of bones (bone spurs).

Cervical spondylosis is very common and worsens with age. More than 85 percent of people older than age 60 are affected by cervical spondylosis.

Symptoms
For most people, cervical spondylosis causes no symptoms. When symptoms do occur, they typically include pain and stiffness in the neck.

Sometimes, cervical spondylosis results in a narrowing of the space needed by the spinal cord and the nerve roots that pass through the spine to the rest of your body. If the spinal cord or nerve roots become pinched, you might experience:

Tingling, numbness and weakness in your arms, hands, legs or feet
Lack of coordination and difficulty walking
Loss of bladder or bowel control


Causes

Cervical spondylosis
Cervical spondylosisOpen pop-up dialog box
As you age, the bones and cartilage that make up your backbone and neck gradually develop wear and tear. These changes can include:

Dehydrated disks. Disks act like cushions between the vertebrae of your spine. By the age of 40, most people's spinal disks begin drying out and shrinking, which allows more bone-on-bone contact between the vertebrae.
Herniated disks. Age also affects the exterior of your spinal disks. Cracks often appear, leading to bulging (herniated) disks — which sometimes can press on the spinal cord and nerve roots.
Bone spurs. Disk degeneration often results in the spine producing extra amounts of bone in a misguided effort to strengthen the spine. These bone spurs can sometimes pinch the spinal cord and nerve roots.
Stiff ligaments. Ligaments are cords of tissue that connect bone to bone. Spinal ligaments can stiffen with age, making your neck less flexible.

            <dt style="font-size: 24px">Varicose veins</dt><dd>Varicose veins are a condition in which the veins in the leg area have become enlarged. If veins have become varicose, the leaflets of the valves do not work properly, and in turn, the vein valves themselves won't work. The blood then flows backwards, at which point the veins then start to increase. This condition is most common in superficial veins which involve the legs. The condition not only causes cosmetic troubles, it also creates itching and painful problems.[1]

            <dt style="font-size: 24px">Alcoholic hepatitis</dt><dd>Alcoholic hepatitis is inflammation of the liver caused by drinking alcohol.

Alcoholic hepatitis is most likely to occur in people who drink heavily over many years. However, the relationship between drinking and alcoholic hepatitis is complex. Not all heavy drinkers develop alcoholic hepatitis, and the disease can occur in people who drink only moderately.

Symptoms
The most common sign of alcoholic hepatitis is yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice).

Other signs and symptoms include:

Loss of appetite
Nausea and vomiting
Abdominal tenderness
Fever, often low grade
Fatigue and weakness
Malnutrition is common in people with alcoholic hepatitis. Drinking large amounts of alcohol suppresses the appetite, and heavy drinkers get most of their calories from alcohol.

Additional signs and symptoms that occur with severe alcoholic hepatitis include:

Fluid accumulation in your abdomen (ascites)
Confusion and behavior changes due to a buildup of toxins normally broken down and eliminated by the liver
Kidney and liver failure</dd>
            <dt style="font-size: 24px">Hepatitis C</dt><dd>Hepatitis C is an infection that mostly affects the liver. The hepatitis C virus (HCV) causes this disease.[1] Often, a person with Hepatitis C does not have any symptoms (health problems or signs that he has the disease). However, chronic infection can scar the liver. Many years of infection may cause cirrhosis. Sometimes, people with cirrhosis also have liver failure or liver cancer. They can also have very swollen veins of the esophagus and stomach. The blood loss from this problem can kill.[1]

Hepatitis C is usually spread by blood-to-blood contact (when blood from a person with Hepatitis C contacts (touches or gets into) another person's bloodstream). The most common ways that this happens are through intravenous drug use (when a person shoots drugs into one of their veins, with a needle that was already used by a person infected with Hepatitis C); nonsterile medical equipment (medical tools that were not cleaned well enough after being used on an infected person); and blood transfusions (when a person is given blood that came from an infected person).

Around the world, about 130–170 million people have Hepatitis C. Scientists began studying the Hepatitis C virus in the 1970s, and in 1989 they proved that the virus exists.[2] As far as scientists know, this virus does not cause disease in any animals other than humans.

The medications that are normally used to treat Hepatitis C are called peginterferon and ribavirin. Between 50 and 80% of people who are treated (or 5 to 8 out of every 10) are cured. However, if a person's Hepatitis C has progressed (or gotten worse) so much that the person has cirrhosis or liver cancer, the person might need a liver transplant (they might need to have surgery where they are given another person's liver, or part of another person's liver). This makes it possible for the person to survive, but the Hepatitis C virus usually comes back after the transplant.[3] There is no vaccine that works to prevent people from getting Hepatitis C.

            <dt style="font-size: 24px">Chicken pox</dt><dd>
Chickenpox, also known as chicken pox, is a disease. Usually, it is children who get the disease, but adults can also get it. People who have it get blisters or spots, mostly on the body and in the face. Those blisters are filled with a liquid. At some point, the blisters will drain, and the person will want to scratch them. Burst blisters usually become healthy without leaving scars, unless they become infected. The symptoms come in two or three waves, and they usually include fever. If there are no complications, the disease will last between three and five days in children. Chickenpox is very common and by the age 14, more than 90% of children will have had the disease.

Getting chickenpox during a pregnancy is dangerous, as it can hurt both the mother and the child.


The Varicella virus, which causes Chickenpox
Chickenpox is caused by a virus of the herpes family. People who had chickenpox in the past can also get a related disease called shingles later. Shingles are caused by the same virus but usually is only one part of the body.

There is a vaccine against chickenpox. Usually, the vaccine is given to children if they did not have the disease before the start of puberty, that is aged 9–13 years old. Sometimes to help your child not to scratch when they have chicken pox, you can get a special cream for it such as e45.

            <dt style="font-size: 24px">Pneumonia</dt><dd>
Pneumonia is a disease of the lungs and the respiratory system. The lung contains many small bulbs, or sacs, called alveoli. These help to take out oxygen from the air. In the case of pneumonia, these bulbs become inflamed. They fill up with a fluid which is called pus, and can no longer absorb as much oxygen as before. This makes it hard for the person with pneumonia to breathe. They may feel out of breath, or like they are drowning. They may also feel pain when they breathe. Sometimes people die of pneumonia, even when they go to a hospital and take medicine.

Other types of pneumonia

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)
SARS is a highly contagious and deadly type of pneumonia which first occurred in 2002 after initial outbreaks in China. SARS is caused by the SARS coronavirus, a pathogen (disease-causing organism) that was not known until then. New cases of SARS have not been seen since June 2003.
Bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP)
BOOP is caused by inflammation (swelling or irritation) of the small airways of the lungs. It is also known as cryptogenic organizing pneumonitis (COP).
Eosinophilic pneumonia
Eosinophilic pneumonia is invasion of the lung by eosinophils. Eosinophils are a particular kind of white blood cells. Eosinophilic pneumonia often occurs in response to infection with a parasite or after exposure to certain types of environmental factors.
Chemical pneumonia
Chemical pneumonia (usually called chemical pneumonitis) is caused by chemical toxins such as pesticides, which may enter the body by inhalation (breathing in) or by skin contact. When the toxic (poisonous or harmful) substance is an oil, the pneumonia may be called lipoid pneumonia.
Aspiration pneumonia
Aspiration pneumonia (or aspiration pneumonitis) is caused by accidentally inhaling oral (mouth) or gastric (stomach) contents into the lungs, either while eating, or after reflux or vomiting, and causing damage to the lungs. The lung inflammation from these materials is not an infection but it can eventually cause one, since the material taken into the lungs may contain bacteria. Aspiration is a common cause of death among hospital and nursing home patients, since they sometimes cannot cough hard enough to protect their airways.

            <dt style="font-size: 24px">Migraine</dt><dd>A migraine is a medical condition which usually causes a pounding, throbbing headache on one side of the head. The pain may be very bad and hurt so much that a person may have a hard time doing anything. While most people who have migraines get a headache, not everyone does. There are different kinds of migraines, and some do not cause a headache but do have other symptoms.

Most migraines cause a headache and nausea and might make the person dizzy or very sensitive to bright lights or loud noises. Some people have "auras" before a migraine starts, which means their ability to see becomes different. They may see funny patterns, have blurry vision, or may not be able to see at all. Other senses can change before or during a migraine, and the person may sense funny smells or tastes. Migraines can last a long time. Migraines usually last between four and 72 hours.

Migraines have been classified, based on how often they happen in a month: If a person has a headache for less than fifteen days, the migraine is called episodic migraine (EM). If it happens more than fifteen days, it is called chronic migraine (CM). Chronic means it happens over a long amount of time. Some people who start off getting episodic migraines may start to get chronic migraines later. Chronic migraine then may revert or go back to episodic migraine.

Scientists have discovered that something called CGRP is the cause of migraines. CGRP stands for "calcitonin gene-related peptide". CGRP is a protein that causes migraines when it is released around the brain. What CGRP does, is that it causes a lot of inflammation in the meninges, a covering above the brain.

There are different risk factors which make a person more likely to have migraines. Being a female is a risk factor, and so is having family members who had migraines. For a person who has migraines, there are different trigger factors which may set off a migraine attack. In a large group of females who have migraines, one of the main trigger factors is when the amount of the hormone estrogen in their body either drops too low or fluctuates (goes up and down).

The World Health Organization says that migraine headache is the most costly brain problem for treatment and disability in the European Union and the United States.[1]

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)[1] is a chronic medical problem involving the part of the body which runs from the mouth to the stomach.[2]

The problem exists when stomach contents move backwards towards the mouth. Food or liquid moves from the stomach into the tube between the mouth and the stomach. That tube is called the oesophagus.[3]

The burning sensation is commonly called "heartburn," but it has nothing to do with the heart.</dd>
            <dt style="font-size: 24px">Malaria</dt><dd>Malaria is an infectious disease caused by a parasite: it is spread by the bite of an infected mosquito. People catch malaria when the parasite enters the blood. The parasite causes a deadly infection which kills many people each year (from 75 million cases in 1950s to 0.1 million cases in 1960s). However, due to the development of insecticide resistance among mosquitoes and other factors, it staged a comeback in the mid 1970s (6.47 million cases in 1976), and continues to prevail in endemic/subendemic proportions, so that 80% indian population lives in malaria risk areas.

Malaria is produced by 4 species of the protozoal parasite Plasmodium, is endemic in many tropical countries. It is one of the most common health problems. As per latest WHO estimates (2011)* between 149–274 (median 216) million clinical cases and ~ 0.655 million deaths occur globally due to malaria each year, 90% of which are in Africa. This amounts to one malaria death every minute. In India, the National Malaria Eradication Programme (NMEP), started in 1958, achieved near complete disappearance of the disease in 1960s (from 75 million cases in 1950s to 0.1 million cases in 1960s).

The parasite that causes malaria is a protozoan called 'Plasmodium'. Protozoa are organisms with only one cell, but they are not bacteria. Bacteria are smaller and simpler than protozoans.

People usually get malaria from the Anopheles or Culex mosquitoes Archived 2019-02-28 at the Wayback Machine: they are the vectors of the disease. The Plasmodium gets into people by the bites of mosquitoes. The Plasmodium is in the mosquito's special saliva.[1] The mosquito's saliva injects an anticoagulant into the person to prevent their blood from clotting. The person is then infected with Plasmodium as a by-product. This makes the person have the disease we call malaria.

Only the female mosquito gives people malaria, because only the female mosquito consumes blood. The male mosquito lives on the nectar of flowers. The female uses blood as a source of protein for its eggs.

Some people do not get malaria from mosquitoes. A baby can get it while inside its mother. This is called maternal-foetal transmission. People can also get malaria from a blood transfusion. This is when someone gives blood to another person. Another way people can catch malaria is by using a needle that someone with the disease used before them.

            <dt style="font-size: 24px">Psoriasis</dt><dd>Psoriasis is a skin condition where cells grow at a faster rate than they can be shed, causing excess skin to build up and form scaly patches on the body.

The condition: It appears to be a buildup of dry skin on your body. You can have it at any age, but normally as you get older. It starts with the skin cracking as a paper cut on your fingertips. This skin would begin to die, flake, peal and itch. As your itch the area, it begins to get red and then it begins to blister like, flake and peals to raw skin. It appears most often on hands, toes, inside arch of your feet and on you heals. It is also shows up in callus, by cracking. When washing hands it has a burning effect.

Living in moist humid climate appears to delay the condition for appearing. Dry arid climates seem to aggravate the condition. Washing your hands has a drying affect, which triggers the condition. When washing, water removes oils from our body, and has a drying effect on our hands. Washing with Psoriasis removes the dry skin, but then the skin underneath is raw. Hard water appears to worsen the condition in dry climates, but not as much in humid areas. Soft water appears better.
